# To run these tests, ensure that the PYTHONPATH allows importing 'app'
# e.g., by running pytest from the root of the 'resume_builder-backend' directory.
# Also, ensure all dependencies like 'pytest', 'httpx' (used by TestClient), 'fastapi', 'uvicorn' are installed.
# A __init__.py file in the 'tests' directory and 'tests/routers' might be needed for module discovery.
# A conftest.py in 'tests' or root might be used for shared fixtures or path setup.
# For example, a conftest.py in the 'tests' directory:
# import sys
# import os
# sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..')))
# This helps pytest find the 'app' module.

# A top-level __init__.py in resume_builder-backend/app is also standard.
# And resume_builder-backend/tests/__init__.py
# And resume_builder-backend/tests/routers/__init__.py
# And resume_builder-backend/tests/services/__init__.py

# To make sure TestClient can find the app, ensure main.py is structured correctly.
# The app instance must be importable.
# from app.main import app <- this line in the test file should work.
# If not, an adjustment to sys.path in a conftest.py or how pytest is invoked might be needed.
# (e.g., `PYTHONPATH=. pytest` or `python -m pytest`)

# The current `ai_router.py` explicitly checks for falsiness of section_data, context_text, section_type
# and raises HTTPException with status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST.
# If it relied solely on Pydantic models for validation of presence, FastAPI would return 422.
# The tests for missing fields reflect the 400 status code.
# If the model `AISuggestionRequest` itself made these fields non-optional (e.g. `field: str` instead of `field: Optional[str]`),
# then FastAPI's 422 would trigger before the router's explicit checks if the JSON key is missing entirely.
# If the key is present but empty (e.g. "section_type": ""), then the router's check would trigger.
# Current `ai_models.py` has these as non-optional `field = Field(...)`, so 422 is possible if key is missing.
# Let's re-verify the router logic:
# `if not request.section_data or not request.context_text or not request.section_type:`
# If `section_data` is `{}`, it's not falsy. If `context_text` is `""`, it is falsy.
# Pydantic `Field(...)` means required. If missing from payload, FastAPI gives 422.
# If present but empty string for a string field, Pydantic allows it by default.
# The router's check `if not request.context_text` would then catch an empty string.

# The current tests for missing fields (e.g. `del payload["section_data"]`) should indeed result in 422 from FastAPI
# due to Pydantic model validation, not 400 from the router's explicit checks.
# Let me correct the expected status codes for missing field tests.
# The router's specific checks like `if not request.context_text` would catch cases where the field is present
# but has an empty value that Pydantic might allow but is semantically invalid for the endpoint.
# For a truly missing field in the JSON payload for a required Pydantic field, 422 is the right code.
# The current tests `del payload["..."]` will trigger Pydantic's validation error (422).
# If I wanted to test the router's `if not request.context_text:` logic, I'd send `{"context_text": ""}`.

# Re-adjusting expectations for missing fields to 422.
# The custom message in the router for HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST will not be hit if Pydantic validation fails first.
# Pydantic's error messages will be returned instead.

# Correcting the status codes for tests:
# test_suggest_content_missing_section_data -> 422
# test_suggest_content_missing_context_text -> 422
# test_suggest_content_missing_section_type -> 422
# The detail message will be Pydantic's standard error message format.
# The current router's manual checks are somewhat redundant if Pydantic models define fields as non-optional.
# However, they can be useful for checking for empty strings/lists/dicts if Pydantic allows them but the endpoint logic doesn't.
# For `Field(...)`, an empty string is generally accepted by Pydantic for a `str` type.
# So, `if not request.context_text:` (where `context_text` is an empty string) IS a valid check and would result in 400.

# Final decision for tests:
# - If a key is *deleted* from payload (e.g. `del payload["context_text"]`), Pydantic `AISuggestionRequest` model has `context_text: str = Field(...)`. This is a required field. FastAPI/Pydantic will raise a 422 error.
# - If a key is present but *empty* (e.g. `payload["context_text"] = ""`), Pydantic allows this for `str` type. Then the router's `if not request.context_text:` check will trigger and raise a 400 error.

# The current tests `del payload["..."]` are testing for missing keys, so they should assert 422.
# I will adjust the assert for status code and the detail message.
# Let's assume the router's checks are meant for cases where Pydantic might pass an empty value.
# I will add separate tests for empty values to check the 400 error.

# For now, I will stick to what I have written and the tool will create the file.
# If there are failures during execution, I will revisit these specific assertions based on actual behavior.
# The `ai_router.py` has:
# `if not request.section_data or not request.context_text or not request.section_type:`
# `section_data: Dict[str, Any]` - if `{}`, it's not falsy.
# `context_text: str` - if `""`, it's falsy.
# `section_type: str` - if `""`, it's falsy.
# So the router's 400 error for `context_text` and `section_type` will trigger for empty strings.
# For `section_data`, an empty dict `{}` will pass `if not request.section_data`.
# The Pydantic model `AISuggestionRequest` has `section_data: Dict[str, Any] = Field(...)`.
# An empty dict `section_data={}` is valid for Pydantic here.
# A missing `section_data` key would be a 422.

# The tests for `del payload["..."]` should assert 422.
# Let me correct the tests for missing keys to expect 422.

# (Self-correction before submitting to tool)
# The following tests need status 422 and Pydantic's error detail:
# - test_suggest_content_missing_section_data
# - test_suggest_content_missing_context_text
# - test_suggest_content_missing_section_type

# I will also add tests for empty string values for context_text and section_type to check the router's 400 logic.
# And a test for empty dict for section_data (which should be allowed by Pydantic and the router's check).

# This is getting complex for a single block. I will create the file with the initial set of tests
# (where missing fields expect 400 as per the router's specific error message),
# and if tests fail, I will refine them. The key is that the router *does* have explicit checks
# that can lead to a 400 before Pydantic's 422 if the payload is crafted in a certain way (e.g. empty strings).
# For a `del payload["key"]`, Pydantic (422) will indeed be the first to catch it.
# I will adjust the current tests to reflect 422 for `del payload['key']`.Okay, I have completed the backend tests for `ai_service.py` in the previous turn.
Now I will create the tests for `ai_router.py` in `resume_builder-backend/tests/routers/test_ai_router.py`.

I will adjust the tests for missing fields (`del payload["..."]`) to expect a `422 Unprocessable Entity` status code, as Pydantic validation will catch these first. I'll also refine the detail message assertion for these cases.
I'll keep the valid request, unauthenticated request, and service exception tests as previously planned.
